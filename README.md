The Image Validator App uploads an image and displays it if the file is a 'jpg' or 'png' file. 

To run the app:
Clone or download the source files. git clone https://github.com/sarahschoonmaker/flask-image-app.git
cd flask-image-app

If you already have Flask and Python installed, CD into the src directory and start the server: python app.py or use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code. Navigate to localhost:8080.
